# TSM CLI

Use this CLI for scaffolding out new projects

## Installation

## Usage

This cli exposes a `tsm` command once installed. Running `tsm` in your terminal will prompt you with a few questions, then use your answers to scaffold out a new project using the [TSM Dev
Environment](https://github.com/TeamSubjectMatter/TSM-Dev-Environment) and [TSM Base Theme](https://github.com/TeamSubjectMatter/tsm-theme.git).
